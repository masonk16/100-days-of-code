# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 3, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Refreshed myself on Python basics and built a simple band name generator.

**Thoughts:** Didn't struggle too much but it was quite nice touching up on basic concepts. After all we do need to master the fundamentals.

### Day 2: November 4, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Refreshed myself on arithmetic, f-Strings and type casting - built a tip calculator to test those concepts.

**Thoughts:** Definitely needed the refressher on floating point arithmetic, went through some Python documentation to help me along.
