# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 3, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Refreshed myself on Python basics and built a simple band name generator.

**Thoughts:** Didn't struggle too much but it was quite nice touching up on basic concepts. After all we do need to master the fundamentals.

### Day 2: November 4, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Refreshed myself on arithmetic, f-Strings and type casting - built a tip calculator to test those concepts.

**Thoughts:** Definitely needed the refressher on floating point arithmetic, went through some Python documentation to help me along.

### Day 3: November 5, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Went through conditionals and logical operators and also a bit of string manipulation.

**Thoughts:** Had fun doing the logicals once I started it just felt really good.

### Day 4: November 6, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Looked at integrating Python and React and API integrations.

**Thoughts:** Definitely a fun build today, got to see where I went wrong on a previous project that had a similar stack.

### Day 5: November 7, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Randomization with Python - gave me a bit of insight on some concepts I had been struggling with.

**Thoughts:** Enjoyed debugging the rock paper scissors game, hit the point home about how proper sturcture can really be important.

### Day 6: November 9, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Worked with Python Loops and lists.

**Thoughts:** Got some really good insight into some operations with loops and refreshed on modules as well. Definitely would like to work more on loops.

### Day 7: November 10, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Continued working with loops and if functions.

**Thoughts:** Combining different types of looping mechanisms was really interesting. Reebord's World really helped with visualising my code.

### Day 8: November 11, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: More python loops, if functions and working with lists.

**Thoughts:** Was really challenging getting the flow of the hangman game right

### Day 9: November 13, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on functions with inputs.

**Thoughts:** Had a fairly good time figuring out how to combine different concepts to build the caesar cipher. Debugging was a nice challenge as well. Though I need to work more with lists.

### Day 10: November 14, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Revisited Dictionaries and nesting.

**Thoughts:** quite the challenge working with nesting, definitely something I need to revisit.

### Day 11: November 15, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Functions with Outputs.

**Thoughts:** The recursive functions were a bit hard but I managed to understand.

### Day 12: November 16, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Revisited all concepts learntso far .

**Thoughts:** Still need to work a bit more with recursive functions.

### Day 13: November 18, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Namespaces in Python - Local vs. Global Scope.

**Thoughts:** Definitely worth a revisit, to my skills in implementing the DRY principle.

### Day 14: November 19, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Debugging.

**Thoughts:** Learnt some crucial debuuging skills and how to create a workflow specifically for that.


### Day 15: November 20, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Recapping on all concepts learnt so far.

**Thoughts:** Would want to redo something similar to test my problem solving skills.

### Day 16: November 21, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Learnt how to leverage my IDE even more while creating a virtual coffe machine.

**Thoughts:** Definitely a project I want to revisit and try a different approach to it.
