# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 3, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Refreshed myself on Python basics and built a simple band name generator.

**Thoughts:** Didn't struggle too much but it was quite nice touching up on basic concepts. After all we do need to master the fundamentals.

### Day 2: November 4, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Refreshed myself on arithmetic, f-Strings and type casting - built a tip calculator to test those concepts.

**Thoughts:** Definitely needed the refressher on floating point arithmetic, went through some Python documentation to help me along.

### Day 3: November 5, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Went through conditionals and logical operators and also a bit of string manipulation.

**Thoughts:** Had fun doing the logicals once I started it just felt really good.

### Day 4: November 6, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Looked at integrating Python and React and API integrations.

**Thoughts:** Definitely a fun build today, got to see where I went wrong on a previous project that had a similar stack.

### Day 5: November 7, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Randomization with Python - gave me a bit of insight on some concepts I had been struggling with.

**Thoughts:** Enjoyed debugging the rock paper scissors game, hit the point home about how proper sturcture can really be important.

### Day 6: November 9, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Worked with Python Loops and lists.

**Thoughts:** Got some really good insight into some operations with loops and refreshed on modules as well. Definitely would like to work more on loops.

### Day 7: November 10, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Continued working with loops and if functions.

**Thoughts:** Combining different types of looping mechanisms was really interesting. Reebord's World really helped with visualising my code.
